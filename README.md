# CS-370 Current and Emerging Trends in CS Portfolio Submission
<br/>

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project:
---
Additionally,<br> 
- What code were you given?
- What code did you create yourself?<br>
***
This project required us to create an agent that could learn to navigate a puzzle in an 8x8 grid. We were expected to utilize a Deep Q-Learning algorithm and develop Python code. The course provided the GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py files and some preliminary code in the work file. I created the learning loop and the parameters for ending the loop with a specific win rate and epsilon factor.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
---
Additionally,<br> 
- What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
- How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
- What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?<br>

I’m nearly done with my CS track, and CS is such a broad field that it’s hard to say what we do without talking all day. Regarding AI, CS focuses on developing the mathematical algorithms and neural networks that make up these agents. We also consider many of the societal and ethical implications of developing any form of AI, whether it’s an LLM, IS, or even as we approach considering an AGI.

I don’t have a specific approach to problem-solving. I prefer trial and error when finding solutions, especially out-of-the-box methods when the tried-and-true don’t resolve the situation. I also value seeking help from peers when appropriate; sometimes, just talking through the problem to another person is enough to send you down the path to a solution. I also value stepping away from a problem after working toward it for some time. This course was certainly a test of patience, especially when building our own environments and ensuring we downloaded the proper files. This course taught me that my PC could not process much of what we attempted because I built my PC with an AMD GPU and the necessary APIs required to have an NVIDIA GPU.

Every CS student is taught the code of ethics early on, and I support it entirely. Our code of ethics reminds us to respect confidentiality and privacy, ensure our products do no harm, and maintain high standards of professionalism. We should also ensure we can do the requested work and clarify if we cannot.
